# Learn Vue

> This repo has been archived due to lack of activity.

This is not a resource for learnig, but a place for me to explore Vue.

## Getting started

Clone and run `npm i`, simple as that.

> NB! You'll have to compile `src/styles/sass/main.scss` with a Sass compiler.

Run server with `npm run dev`.
